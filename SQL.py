• SQL Challenge:
“Given a sales table, write a query to find the top 3 selling products by revenue per region.”
I focused on using ROW_NUMBER() with partitioning to handle this efficiently.
 • Python & Pandas:
“You have a DataFrame with duplicate customer records—how would you identify and remove exact and near duplicates?”
I discussed drop_duplicates(), fuzzy matching with difflib, and when to use clustering for deduplication at scale.
 • Statistics & A/B Testing:
“If an A/B test shows a lift of 3%, how do you know it’s statistically significant?”
Talked about p-values, confidence intervals, and using scipy.stats.ttest_ind() for validation.


                                                                                      
 • Key Topics: Complex queries, window functions, query optimization, and handling large datasets.
 • Sample Questions:
 • Write a query to find the median salary of employees in a table.
 • Identify and remove duplicate records from a table, keeping the most recent record based on a timestamp column.
 • Write a query to compute the moving average of daily transactions over a 7-day window.
 • How would you optimize a query that is running slowly on a large table with billions of rows?

 • Write a query to find the top 5 most ordered dishes in the last 30 days.
 • Calculate a 7-day moving average of orders.

 • Star schema vs. snowflake schema—what’s better for reporting?
 • How would you design a warehouse to handle Swiggy’s order data
